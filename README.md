## Laboratory 9 Assignment

### Assigned: November 11, 2024

### Due: November 18, 2024 (before 3:30 pm)

---

## Learning Goals

1.  Utilize a numerical integration method to solve an engineering problem.
2.  Continue practicing writing user defined functions, and
2.  Produce an estimate within $\pm 1\%$ of the true value to receive full credit.

## Problem Description

Solve the following problem:

$$
\int_{0.5}^2\frac{e^x\sin x}{x^3+1}\,dx
$$


## Your Solution

### Cell 1

Update your personal information found in the first cell that is a Markdown cell.

### Cell 2

In cell 2 (Markdown cell), describe the numerical integration technique that you will use and the reason you selected your numerical integration technique. 

### Cell 3

In cell 3 (code cell), enter the Python code to implement your numerical integration solution. Your solution must include a user-defined function that returns $f(x)=\frac{e^x\sin x}{x^3+1}$.
